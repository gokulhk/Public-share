Linear Search :
===============
	=> Applicable on both sorted and unsorted list.
	=> List can be Array or Linked List.
	=> T(n) = O(n)
        => S(n) = O(1) - Iterative Implementation
        => S(n) = O(n) - Recurive Implementation

Binary Search:
==============
	=> Applicable only on Sorted List.
	=> List can only be Array.
	=> T(n) = O(lg n)
	=> S(n) = O(1) - Iterative Implementation
	=> S(n) = O(lg n) - Recurive Implementation
